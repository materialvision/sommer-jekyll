The Ouroboros is an instrument developed by Espen Sommer Eide for the Bergen Assembly triennials instrument/performance program 'Within', curated by Tarek Atoui and Council.  
  

The instrument is developed in cooperation with deaf performers or with different levels of hearing. The instrument is comprised of custom made microphones, pedals and speakers. Through vibrations in the instrument, feedback sounds/vibrations are generated and shaped in the mouth cavity of the performer. This is in turn shaped by a construction of tubes to be tuned to various scales. In this way the performer "sings" without making any sounds by his/her own vocal chords. The instrument investigates language, communication and learning processes.Â   
  
Opening performance was at Bergen Assembly 2. September 2016.&nbsp;
