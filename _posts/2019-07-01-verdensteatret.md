VERDENSTEATRET is an artist collective based in Oslo. The group's continuous artistry has been established over the last 30 years. The group was founded in Bergen in 1986 by Lisbeth J. Bodd and Asle Nilsen, with background from respectively theatre and visual art.  
  
Latest piece now touring is "Trust me tomorrow" (see full information [here](http://verdensteatret.com/trust-me-tomorrow)):

Today the group consists of artists representing many different artistic genres and professions. They endeavour to use a collaborative process to deeply integrate different artistic disciplines into projects that bridge the gap between artistic boarders.

Verdensteatret's poetics are characterized by an ongoing experimentation within different medias by building complex links between seemingly incompatible technologies and materials. An experimental use of audiovisual technology in close dialogue with more traditional tools of artistic expression results in large scale orchestral works and space-related musical compositions.   
  

They have developed a complex audio-visual expression, where emerging landscapes of sound integrated with sculptured scenography and bits of fragile, human tale.

_Seeing the sound, listening to the images._   
  

They say that their activity now has become a ”telling orchestra” that performs compositions in the “movable room genre”. Established notions of form or style about performance are more or less useless for these peculiarly captivating works.   
  

Their works are presented widely international in different art contexts and locations, such as art museums, contemporary music festivals and theatres.    
  

Verdensteatret is supported by [Arts Council Norway](http://kulturradet.no/) and other official art-foundations in Norway.
